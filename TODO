- Avoid duplication of Label and Label2 ({Robot,Link,Joint}.onBeforeChange())
- Validate Label2 (or Label if Label2 is not defined) against valid URDF names ({Robot,Link,Joint}.onBeforeChange())
- Handle star-style macro parameters (e.g. `*origin` in `robotiq-3f-gripper_articulated.urdf.xacro`)
- Set `JointAxisLength` to a value adapated to the robot size when importing URDF.
- URDF editor integrated in Robot
- Clear necessary fields when `XacroObject.InputFile` is reset
- Fix bug when setting a prefix in XacroObject, then setting it to ''. Some objects are deleted but not all and the Cross::Robot cannot be rebuilt.
- Fix Attachment for the root link in `assembly_from_urdf`
- Provide a tool to set the inertial parameters automatically.
- Add two coordinate systems for each Cross::Joint in `assembly_from_urdf` (parent = urdf_joint.origin, child = parent * get_actuation_placement())
- Do not create an extra FreeCAD link when importing a URDF since the part can be directly added to the ROS links (i.e. instead of creating a FreeCAD link and adding the FreeCAD link to the ROS link). FreeCAD links are only necessary if the parts are in a different file.
- Support all joint types
