- Use `Joint.onBeforeChange` to remember the parent and child CrossLinks, then restore `Parent` and `Child` with `obj.Parent = ros_name(saved_parent_link)
- Avoid duplicating mesh objects when importing
- URDF editor integrated in Robot
- Avoid duplication of Label2
- Validate Label2 (and Label if Label2 is not defined) against valid URDF names
- Clear necessary fields when `XacroObject.InputFile` is reset
- Fix bug when setting a prefix in XacroObject, then setting it to ''. Some objects are deleted but not all and the Cross::Robot cannot be rebuilt.
- Fix Attachment for the root link in `assembly_from_urdf`
- Add two coordinate systems for each Cross::Joint (parent = urdf_joint.origin, child = parent * get_actuation_placement())
- Do not create an extra FreeCAD link when importing a URDF since the part can be directly added to the ROS links (i.e. instead of creating a FreeCAD link and adding the FreeCAD link to the ROS link). FreeCAD links are only necessary if the parts are in a different file.
- Support all joint types
